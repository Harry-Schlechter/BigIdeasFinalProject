    "## Introduction\n",
    "Our project aims to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh through unconventional means. We all thought that other groups would use \"positive\" data sets like highest income, highest property value etc. While this is valid and probably a common approach we decided to use an unconventional one. We mostly looked for data sets that looked at negative aspects. This was our approach right away after the first data set we looked at was one about arrests by neighborhood.  We always intended to take this \"negative\" approach and never really explored alternatives, though later on we added a positive data set as well. After we all searched for data sets we ended up finding some perfect for our project and settled on median age at death, number of parks, and arrests. Later on we will go into our metric and submetrics in more detail, but we came up with our metric by combining these submetrics and comibining the neighborhoods \"score\" for each submetric to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh"

    "## The Metric\n",
    "Our metric combines three submetrics from three different data sets. The first metric uses the median age at death by neighborhood dataset. The submetric rates each neighborhood on a 0-100 scale based on its reported median age at death. The second submetric looks at arrests by incident location and ranks them in reverse order. The third submetric counts the parks in each neighborhood. All of these submetrics combine to to create our overall metric based on the death age, arrests, and number of parks of each nieghborhood in Pittsburgh to determine the best one. "

There is a very important distinction between visitng a neighborhood to go shopping and actually living in that neighborhood.
