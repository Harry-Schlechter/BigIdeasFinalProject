    "This dataset provides information on parks in the city of Pittsburgh. It was compiled by the Department of Public Works. It includes ID, name of park, type of park, who is responsible for the maintenance, an image of the park, the neighborhood the park is in, the council district the park is in, the ward, the tract, the public works division, the pli division, the police and fire zone, and the latitude and longitude. For our purposes, we will mostly be looking at the neighborhood the parks are in.\n",

Having a large amount of parks is not only good for families with children, but for people in general. It is important to go outside and get fresh air, so living somewhere with a lot of parks makes this easy.\n"
