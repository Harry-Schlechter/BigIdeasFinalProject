Median Age at Death 2011-15 by Neighborhood, City of Pittsburgh 
The median age at death for each neighborhood in Alleghany county. The data is based soley on the residence at death not the location where death occured. Black and white deaths were measured in the data set, but for the purpose of our metric demographic specific deaths were ignored in favor of total deaths.
